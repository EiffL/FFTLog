# FFTLog
C and C++ implementations of FFTLog algorithm

This is famous FFTLog. 

First imlplemented by the living legend Andrew Hamilton:

This version is a C version that was adapted from the C++ version found
in Copter JWG Carlson, another big loss for the cosmology community.

I've transformed this from C++ to C99 as the lowest common denominator
and provided bindings for C++ and python.

There are C++ bindings, which are not tested yet, though.

# Notes

To compile, edit Makefile and run. The only dependency is FFTW3.
